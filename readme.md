##**Exe files from:**## 
Special thanks to these guys!

yt-dlp.exe → [HERE](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
ffmpeg.7z → [HERE](https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg/releases/tag/2025-03-03-git-d21ed2298e)

##**Important!**##     
1. download all required files and folders.    
2. unzip the ffmpeg.7z into the “source” folder (it is already there, just unzip it into the same folder), 
	 otherwise audio and video will be downloaded separately and not merged!	
3. run ytdl.bat.
4. paste the YouTube link when prompted.
5. good luck! Sometimes YouTube just doesn't want you to download long videos.
6. a folder with the file will be created on your desktop. 
    If the download is successful, you will find your video there afterwards.

    The current setting is optimized for YouTube videos longer than 2 hours.
    The script runs until it has successfully downloaded the video.
    
    If necessary, you can edit the values in config.ini. 
    More information: [HERE] (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/README.md).

    I created this batch file out of frustration with the standard procedure, 
	because I was trying to download a 31-hour YouTube video and it kept failing.

    There is a one minute pause between each failed attempt.
    If the script continues to fail, restart your router - YouTube has probably blocked your IP address.
    You can edit the script as you wish.
