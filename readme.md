Exe files from:

    yt-dlp.exe â†’ https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
    ffmpeg.7z â†’ https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg/releases/tag/2025-03-03-git-d21ed2298e
    âž¡ Special thanks to these guys!

Important:

    Download all required files and folders.
    Extract the ffmpeg.7z in the "source" folder (its already there just unpack it in the same folder), otherwise audio and video will be downloaded separately and not merged!
    Run ytdl.bat.
    Paste the YouTube link when prompted.
    Good luck! ðŸ˜Š Sometimes YouTube simply does not want you to download long videos.
    If done it creates a folder on your desktop with the file.

Current setup is optimized for YouTube videos longer than 2 hours.

    The script runs indefinitely until it may successfully downloads the video.
    If needed, you can edit the values in config.ini. More info: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/README.md.
    
    I created this batch file out of frustration with the standard procedure, because I wanted to download a 31-hour YouTube video, and it kept failing.
    Between each failed attempt, there is a one-minute break.
    If the script keeps failing, restart your routerâ€”YouTube has likely blocked your IP.

    Feel free to edit what ever you want
